# Yet Another Ham Logger (YAHAML)

Collaborative ham radio logging with a focus on **group/club workflows**, **UDP interoperability**, and **remote rig control**.

## Goals
- Multi-user logging by callsign with shared activity context (Field Day, POTA, SOTA, contest, custom).
- Interop with existing tools via standard UDP logging patterns.
- Rig control via HAMLib (local and remote).
- Portable, modular deployment with Docker Compose.

## Non-Goals (for MVP)
- Replacing every feature of N1MM/DXLab/N3FJP on day one.
- Proprietary protocol cloning without understanding licensing/legal constraints.

## Quick Start (placeholder)
This repo will include a Docker Compose setup and service definitions once the architecture is finalized.
