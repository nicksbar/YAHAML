# Risks & Mitigations

- **Interop complexity:** prioritize one UDP format for MVP and add others iteratively.
- **Protocol ambiguity:** maintain test fixtures and golden payloads.
- **Rig control variability:** isolate HAMLib integration behind a service boundary.
- **Scope creep:** maintain MVP acceptance criteria.
