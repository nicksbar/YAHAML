# Contributing

Thanks for helping! This project is early-stage; the best contributions right now are **requirements**, **protocol research**, and **testability guidance**.

## How to Contribute
1. Review docs/requirements.md and docs/architecture.md.
2. Open an issue using the templates in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
3. Submit PRs with clear scope and tests where applicable.

## Definition of Done
- Requirements: clearly stated, testable, and scoped.
- Code: includes tests or test plan where applicable.
- Docs: updated if behavior or architecture changes.

## Legal/Ethical
Do not include proprietary assets or decompiled content in this repo. Protocol analysis should be documented at a high level with independently derived observations.
